This repository is a collection of code used in prior projects to solve specific problems.  It is collected here as a resource of examples and solutions in current and current and future projects.

Technology is all over the map - you'll find things written in C#, CSS, HTML, XML, Gherkin, spreadsheets and just about any tool that was handy at the time.

I'm always willing to share and learn.  Contact me at mlocke5324@gmail.com.
